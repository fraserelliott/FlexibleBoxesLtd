## What is this?

This was a website made using HTML and CSS to build upon and showcase my understanding of flexbox. It started from a wireframe site which I then made into a basic setup, then added styling to using variables to keep a consistent colour pallette that I can easily update.

The page is organised using flexbox to give a reactive look that changes with the window size and uses a media query to change the banner to display containers in separate rows as well as adjust padding and margins to work better on smaller screens e.g. phones. I made the main content boxes by defining 2 classes:
- wrappingcontainer: this defines a flex container where the content is allowed to wrap
- panel: these are each of the boxes containing information/forms etc between the banner and footer (exclusive)

The logo was drawn using Paint.NET. Other images were either royalty free or AI generated. AI was only used for generating images.
