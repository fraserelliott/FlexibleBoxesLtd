## What is this?

This was a website made using HTML and CSS to build upon and showcase my understanding of flexbox. It started from a wireframe site which I then made into a basic setup, then added styling to using variables to keep a consistent colour pallette that I can easily update.

The page is organised using flexbox to give a reactive look that changes with the window size and uses a media query to change the banner to display containers in separate rows to work better on smaller screens e.g. phones.

The logo was drawn using Paint.NET. Other images were either royalty free or AI generated.
