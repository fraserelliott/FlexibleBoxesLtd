## What is this?

This was a website made using HTML and CSS to build upon and showcase my understanding of flexbox. It started from a wireframe site which I then made into a basic setup, then added styling to using variables to keep a consistent colour pallette that I can easily update.

The logo was drawn using Paint.NET. Other images were either royalty free or AI generated.
